**|Version 1.1 Update|**

* Script's name is now changable and won't cause any issues.

**|Version 1.2 Update|**

* Added individual webhooks for each whitelist job.

**|Version 1.3 Update|**

* Added individual waypoints for each non-whitelist job. After a player changes to a non-whitelist job, the corresponding waypoint is set on the map. This feature can be turned on or off using the `useWaypoints` variable in the Config.

* Implemented a restriction preventing players currently in a whitelist job from applying to non-whitelist jobs.

**|Version 1.4 Update|**

* The webhook system has been enhanced to automatically split messages that exceed Discordâ€™s limit. This means you can now include unlimited questions and answers with no restrictions on word count.
